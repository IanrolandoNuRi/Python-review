# Exercise 1.2: Mixed Operations
# Create variables a, b, and c and assign them the values 8, 2, and 5, respectively.

a, b, c = 8, 2, 5 

# Calculate and print the result of the following expressions:

#a + b * c
plus_and_prod = a + b * c
print(plus_and_prod)

#(a + b) * c
asc_plus_and_prod = (a + b) * c
print(asc_plus_and_prod)

# a / b - c
quotient_and_minus = a / b - c
print(quotient_and_minus)

# a % b + c
remainder_and_plus = a % b + c
print(remainder_and_plus)

# a % b + c
a_pow_b = a ** b
print(a_pow_b)
